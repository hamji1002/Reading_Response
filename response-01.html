        <h1>The Garden<br>& The Cloud</h1>

        <p>Early in the essay, Schwulst mentions students emailing her after the semester to ask, “So how do I actually make a website?” My first interpretation of that question was very literal and technical: publishing. Before metaphors like the shelf or the puddle arrive, I read it as anxiety about deploying what they wrote: where the files go, how a site becomes reachable outside of a local folder, what it means to put something on a server and attach a domain to it. I remember mentioning this in class when we paused on that line, because “actually making a website” often feels, to someone who has coded before, like the gap between writing code and having it exist in public. I’ve felt that gap before. The site “works” on my laptop, but it isn’t a website yet. It’s just a folder until it has a URL, a place, and a way to be reached. That practical anxiety is familiar to me not only because I’ve coded before, but also because I tend to treat making as building. Something has to stand, load, and be entered. What the essay does next is widen that gap into something more interesting. It’s not only a technical hurdle, but also a social and conceptual one: what kind of space you are choosing to build, and what kind of behavior you want that space to have over time.

One of the most important moves in Laurel Schwulst’s essay is her rejection of the internet-as-cloud metaphor. The cloud suggests something abstract, distant, and already complete, an infrastructure that feels too large to touch and too opaque to question. By contrast, Schwulst insists that the web is not one seamless entity, but a network made of discrete parts: individual computers, files, links, and decisions that are cared for or neglected by people. This shift matters because it returns responsibility and agency to the individual. A website is not something floating “out there,” but something built, shaped, tended, or abandoned by someone. Against the abstraction of the cloud, Schwulst proposes grounded metaphors such as rooms, shelves, plants, gardens, puddles, and thrown rocks, which pull the web back into a human scale.

What really compelled me is that these metaphors are not simply descriptive. They imply different relationships to time, care, and interaction, different ways a website can behave. A room is finite and oriented. It has boundaries, adjacencies, and thresholds. Entering a room means becoming aware of where you are in relation to other spaces. The shelf, nested inside the room, sharpens this logic further. A shelf demands choice. A single shelf cannot hold everything, and meaning emerges through arrangement: what sits next to what, what has been removed, what is temporarily placed and later replaced. Interaction here is compositional rather than additive.

Moving on from the room and the shelf, the plant and the garden metaphors introduce a different mode of interaction and web-making. They resist immediacy and control. Growth happens slowly, often invisibly, and not always in response to intention. A garden also accepts dormancy. Winter isn’t failure; it’s a necessary phase. In a digital culture that equates activity with value, this metaphor feels especially generous. It allows a website to be quiet without being dead, and unfinished without being lacking. Interaction becomes metabolic, shaped by time, return, neglect, and care rather than constant input. This way of thinking reminds me of how platforms like Naver Blog have been used in South Korea. Often, they feel less like polished portfolios and more like long-term personal ground. Many blogs sit dormant for months or years, then quietly resume, posts reappearing without explanation, sometimes addressed to no one in particular. There is rarely pressure for coherence, optimization, or completion. Older entries remain visible alongside newer ones, not archived away but left to age in place. In that sense, these blogs behave less like feeds and more like gardens, where accumulation happens unevenly, pauses are expected, and meaning forms gradually through repetition and return.

The puddle shifts the logic again. Unlike the plant, it does not promise growth or continuity. A puddle forms suddenly, reflects intensely, and evaporates. It is complete precisely because it is temporary. What feels important to me here is that a puddle is not a “thing” so much as a result. It exists because certain conditions aligned: rain fell, the ground allowed it to collect, the temperature slowed evaporation. Thinking of a website as a puddle reframes it as an event rather than a container, something that appears under conditions, holds attention briefly, and then dissolves. This specific temporality also reminds me of the culture of pop-up stores, which are especially prevalent in South Korea right now. Pop-ups aren’t permanent spaces. They are the result of a moment: cultural attention, marketing timing, spatial opportunity, and social circulation aligning briefly. Their temporariness isn’t a weakness but a strategy. People engage with them precisely because they will disappear. Like puddles, pop-ups are records of conditions rather than stable objects. When they vanish, they leave behind traces: photos, memories, impressions, rather than ongoing obligations. Their value lies in intensity and presence, not longevity.

Thinking through pop up temporality also clarifies how I default to approaching the web. Because I have coded before and I study architecture, I start with structure. Files and folders, paths, servers, links, and the small logic of what breaks and what holds. To me a website is something you stabilize before it becomes something you experience. I treat it like a model. I want to understand the frame first, then tune what it feels like to move through it. Schwulst does not reject that instinct, but she redirects it. Her critique of the cloud reminds me that the web is not distant or inevitable. It is made of discrete, human scale pieces that can be tended or neglected. After reading her, I think less about finishing a site and more about the conditions it lives under. At the same time, architecture makes it hard for me to ignore what holds up. Time, use, and decay are real tests. So even if the web is more reversible than a building, it still needs coherence to keep working, and maintenance still shows up quietly in the background.

For Project 1, I’m trying to build a small website that treats fragments as material, and lets the structure do some of the work. The content will be collected moments—images and short notes from ordinary days—because those are the things I keep noticing. I’m not trying to cover my life or make a complete archive. I just want the site to hold fragments by time and condition, grouped loosely by when they were encountered, with small, repeatable annotations such as how the light behaved and what my body was doing. Ideally, I believe that meaning comes from adjacency and return—what sits next to what, what repeats, what quietly shifts when I add something new. Using HTML to give the site a clear structure and CSS to keep it readable, I want it to stay mutable: something I can rearrange, pause, and revise.</p>
