        <h1>The Handmade Web</h1>

        <p>There is a particular quality to objects made by hand, a kind of presence that stays embedded in the result, even when the maker is gone. I notice it most clearly in processes where time remains visible in the material: film developed and printed in the darkroom, an architectural model that still carries fingerprints along a glue line, or a print pulled from a plate where pressure and ink leave small inconsistencies you would never bother to fake. Handmade does not automatically mean better, but it makes responsibility harder to hide, because the object keeps a record of decisions—small compromises, corrections, misalignments, and the labor that held it together. Reading J. R. Carpenter’s “A Handmade Web,” I was surprised by how naturally this logic transfers to web pages, and by how urgent it feels now, when so much of the web is mediated by corporate platforms, templates, and tools designed to smooth away the marks of making.

Carpenter’s “handmade web” is not simply a nostalgic description of early web aesthetics; it is an argument about authorship and maintenance. The handmade web names pages coded by hand rather than generated by software, pages made and kept by individuals rather than institutions, and pages that are provisional, temporary, or singular in a way the contemporary web rarely allows. What matters is not only how these pages look, but how they behave and what they permit: they can challenge conventions of reading and writing, design and ownership, privacy and identity, because they do not begin as products and they do not assume the reader is a user to be managed. A handmade site, in this framing, feels closer to a small publication, an artist book, or a private note that somehow remains public—not because it is optimized, but because someone continues to care for it.

The essay situates this practice in the mid-to-late 1990s, between what Carpenter calls the academic web and the corporate web, and Olia Lialina’s description of the vernacular web as bright, rich, personal, slow, and under construction helps clarify the difference in mood. “Under construction” is the phrase that stays with me, because it implies a web that did not pretend to be finished, did not smooth away its seams, and did not hide scaffolding. The contemporary web, by contrast, performs seamlessness: frictionless interfaces, standardized layouts, stability as a brand promise. The vernacular web reads more like a neighborhood of self-built structures, each with its own tempo and logic, and although it is easy to romanticize that era, Carpenter does something more useful than nostalgia. She frames it as a moment when participation was structured differently, before professional tools, corporate platforms, and “best practices” narrowed what a webpage was allowed to be.

One of the strongest moves in the essay is how directly Carpenter connects handmade web pages to handmade print culture: zines, pamphlets, artist books. That resonated with how I understand making and publishing, because a zine is not only content but format, sequence, and constraint, where the binding decision shapes how reading unfolds. A portfolio often seals work as finished; a zine is comfortable showing process, misalignment, and thought that has not yet settled. Carpenter’s own example makes the connection tangible. She describes making a web-based work in 1995 that emerged from fine art and book-making practices, where the physical installation left no trace, the book-work exists as a single copy, and the original digital files now sit on storage media she can no longer access, while the handmade website remains online and still works. That reversal was striking to me, because it flips our usual assumption that the physical is permanent and the digital is fragile, and it suggests that hand-coded HTML can act as a durable archive precisely because it is simple enough to survive.

This durability also introduces the tension Carpenter names as a temporal paradox. When we view old web pages through modern browsers, the past does not appear as a clean museum display; it appears layered, sometimes awkwardly, sometimes almost beautifully. Old design aesthetics overlap like wallpaper, pages optimized for small resolutions sit inside wide contemporary viewports, broken links and missing images appear like gaps, and warnings written for another reader still speak even though they are not addressed to us. What I didn’t expect was how quickly these pages stopped feeling like historical evidence and started functioning more like a philosophical tool. In a digital environment that keeps accelerating, their slowness is not just an aesthetic effect; it makes time visible again, and it turns browsing into something closer to remembering than consuming.

Because I study architecture, I can’t help reading this layering spatially. When you enter an old building, you do not encounter a single “past”; you encounter layers of use, maintenance, neglect, and repair, and you register those layers through the body—where you pause, what you lean toward, how your attention moves across surfaces. Carpenter’s description of legacy web pages made me realize something similar happens online: the experience of a page is not only visual, it is durational and physical in small ways, shaped by waiting, scrolling, clicking, and the repeated effort of trying to reach what is missing or half-broken. In other words, the “temporal paradox” is not just an idea you understand intellectually; you feel it through micro-actions, as the interface asks your hand to work and your attention to persist.

That bodily dimension is easy to overlook because the web often feels weightless. But the “temporal paradox” Carpenter describes is experienced through posture and repetition: the slight forward lean at a laptop, the wrist that keeps scrolling, the patience required to try again when something doesn’t load. When I tried to look up Daniel Eatock’s The One Mile Scroll while reading, the site was down. Even that interruption felt instructive—this is not a frictionless archive but a living web, with gaps, downtime, and the small labor of waiting, retrying, and accepting temporary unreachability.

This is where Carpenter’s emphasis on the body became unexpectedly important to me. Her discussion of the manual labor of the mouse hand reframes interaction as effort and distance, where scrolling becomes a kind of measured travel and attention becomes something the body has to hold. That point resonates with me in a very literal way, because physical making—whether it is a model, a print, or a darkroom session—always leaves something in the body: small cuts on fingers, an awkward shoulder, a neck that stiffens, and a posture you only notice once you stand up. I think I’m drawn to this because I often treat “labor” as something visible only when it leaves a mark, and the web has become very good at hiding its marks. Carpenter insists the hand is still there, doing work, even when the work is reduced to smooth gestures.

That idea connects directly to how I learn, and it is something our professor also emphasized in class. When I encounter a website that is especially well designed, or that has a functionality I don’t understand yet, I look for the source code—not to copy it, but to study its structure the way you might trace a drawing or rebuild a joint detail to understand how it stands. Carpenter’s examples make this literacy cultural rather than personal. Rothberg’s Unindexed, a site that deletes itself once Google indexes it, turns visibility and searchability into conditions rather than neutral facts. And Nick Montfort’s Taroko Gorge, rewritten by dozens of readers, shows how the handmade web stays alive through revision: it invites rewriting as a legitimate mode of participation, where making means taking something apart, touching the mechanism, and rebuilding it with your own decisions.

This is also where iteration becomes central—not as a studio concept borrowed to sound poetic, but as an actual tradition inside handmade web culture. Taroko Gorge is important here precisely because it treats code as something you can return to, re-voice, and re-structure without needing permission. That way of working mirrors what a professor told me during my first year at RISD: iteration isn’t repetition for refinement alone, it is a way of thinking that only happens through making. You change one variable, you run it again, you see what breaks, and your understanding arrives through the loop. In physical making, you can feel that in the hand—adjusting pressure, changing a sequence, redoing a cut. Carpenter’s account of rewriting carries that same logic into the web. A handmade site isn’t authored once and sealed; it accumulates versions, edits, and returns, and those returns become part of what the object is.

This matters for my own Project 1 because the site I’m building assumes return. The materials are fragments—photos and small text notes—and I’m not trying to turn them into a complete archive or a finished statement. I want to let meaning emerge through adjacency and repetition: what sits next to what, what reappears, what shifts when I add something new. The “revisited” condition in my project is not only a content category; it is a method. It requires me to go back into the code and re-encounter the same images and lines of text, rearranging them, re-captioning them, and sometimes realizing that what I thought I was holding onto has changed. In that sense, the handmade quality of the project is not only that I am writing HTML and CSS myself, but that the site carries evidence of return, like a zine that has been reassembled and reprinted, where the work gathers time rather than closing it.

Carpenter makes clear that this is not only an artistic preference but also a political stance. In a web dominated by multinational corporations, proprietary platforms, sealed devices, and systems designed to hide their seams, hand-coding and self-publishing become increasingly radical gestures. Smallness becomes a refusal of scale, and slowness becomes a refusal of the constant pressure to optimize and smooth everything into sameness—not because handmade rejects technology, but because it insists that making remain visible. This reading makes me want to treat my own site less as an interface to perfect and more as a crafted object with time embedded in it, where certain seams are left deliberately perceptible, not as nostalgia, but as an honest disclosure of construction—a quiet glue line that proves the page was made, and that it can be made again. </p>
